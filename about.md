- [**Simulizer**](https://github.com/ToastNumber/Simulizer/): My team and I developed a piece of software that allows you to simulate and visualise the running of a MIPS processor. We attempted to create a system that could supersede SPIM, and our project will hopefully be used as an official university resource next year. Our project was awarded the IBM Team Project prize.
- [**Dalriada**](http://dalriadaschool.com/?p=3998): This article was written by a number of teachers at my secondary school after I started university.
- [**Demonstrator for Elements of Functional Computing**](https://github.com/duta/focs-2015-16): I was a demonstrator for the Elements of Functional Computing, which meant I wrote the test harnesses for the students' assignments. You can find the code for the assignments in this repository.
